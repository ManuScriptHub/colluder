# Colluder

This is a collaborative music environment.  It involves what is essentially a
tracker, written in Elm, for composing songs.  It will soon involve an Elixir
Phoenix-based application to provide persistence and collaboration for those
songs.

## Try it out

You can try out the current version of just the editor at
<http://knewter.github.io/colluder>.

## Development

### Elm

The elm-based music editor lives in the `elm` subdirectory.

### Phoenix

The collaboration and persistence bits live in the `conspire` subdirectory.
